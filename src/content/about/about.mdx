Hey there! Iâ€™m Federico, a Product Desiger working as a Design System Designer in Banco Galicia, one of the biggest argentinan banks located in Buenos Aires.
I love solve everyday problems and find new ways to make complex things simplier.

In my spare times, you can find me mainly playing videogames or running or cycling.
I also collect snearkers, watches and all kind of smart gadgets, recently get really into home automation.
